# Design Guidelines for AI Kiddo

## Colour Palette
Our app uses a vibrant, modern, and minimal colour palette inspired by claymorphism and designed to be friendly for kids.

### Primary Colour Palette (Claymorphic)
| Colour Name | Hex Code  |
|-------------|-----------|
| Peach       | #faac96   |
| Aqua        | #90dec8   |
| Purple      | #9d8bed   |
| Yellow      | #f8c75e   |
| Green       | #78d9ad   |
| Lavender    | #cb97e0   |

### Secondary Colour Palette (Legacy)
| Colour Name | Hex Code |
|-------------|----------|
| Sunflower   | #ffb703  |
| Orange      | #fb8500  |
| Blue        | #219ebc  |
| Sky Blue    | #8ecae6  |

> **Usage:** Use the primary (claymorphic) palette for main UI elements, backgrounds, and illustrations. Use the secondary palette for accents, highlights, and supporting elements.

## Design Principles

- **Modern & Minimal**: Clean layouts, generous whitespace, and a focus on essential content.
- **Claymorphism**: Soft, extruded shapes with subtle shadows and highlights to create a playful, tactile interface.
- **Kids Friendly**: Large, approachable buttons, rounded edges, and intuitive navigation. Typography and iconography are clear and readable.

## Usage Notes
- Use the above colours as primary and accent colours throughout the app.
- Maintain consistency in spacing, border-radius, and shadow effects to reinforce the claymorphism style.
- Prioritize accessibility and clarity in all design elements.
