# Environment Variables Configuration Diagnostic

## The Problem

When integrating AI services (Haiku, Replicate, and ElevenLabs) into the AI Kiddo app, we encountered issues with environment variables not being properly loaded at runtime. This document explains what went wrong and how we resolved it.

## Timeline of Changes and Issues

### Initial Implementation
1. We created AI service files with the standard `process.env.KEY_NAME` approach to access environment variables:
   - `ai-content.ts` for story generation via Haiku API
   - `image-generation.ts` for image generation via Replicate API
   - `voice-generation.ts` for audio generation via ElevenLabs API

2. Updated the `.env` file with API keys:
   ```
   HAIKU_API_KEY=your_key
   REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_key
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key
   ```

3. Error encountered: `Haiku API key not found` - indicating environment variables weren't being loaded

### Attempted Fix #1: Expo Environment Variables Convention
1. Modified `.env` file to use Expo's naming convention:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_HAIKU_API_KEY=your_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key
   ```

2. Updated service files to match these new names
3. Error persisted - only Azure keys were being loaded correctly

### Attempted Fix #2: Multiple Configuration Approaches
We attempted several approaches simultaneously, which led to conflicts:

1. Created `app.config.js` to explicitly load environment variables
2. Added `babel.config.js` with react-native-dotenv configuration
3. Installed additional dependencies:
   - expo-constants
   - react-native-dotenv
4. Changed service files to use `@env` imports
5. Added TypeScript declarations in `env.d.ts`

### Breaking Point
The app stopped loading completely after these multiple configuration changes, showing a blank screen with "Welcome to Expo" instead of the actual app.

## Root Causes

1. **Configuration Conflicts**: Multiple configuration files (app.config.js, babel.config.js) conflicted with Expo's default configuration
2. **Dependency Issues**: Adding react-native-dotenv without properly configuring its peer dependencies
3. **Incompatible Approaches**: Trying to use both Constants.expoConfig and @env imports simultaneously
4. **Too Many Changes**: Making too many configuration changes at once without testing each step

## How We Fixed It

1. Removed all conflicting configuration files:
   - Deleted `babel.config.js`
   - Deleted `app.config.js`
   - Deleted `env.d.ts`

2. Reverted service files to use the simpler approach:
   ```typescript
   const API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY;
   ```

3. Reverted tsconfig.json to its original state
4. Restarted the Expo development server with a clean cache (`npx expo start -c`)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Make Incremental Changes**: Change one thing at a time when dealing with configuration
2. **Follow Expo's Documentation**: Stick to the official approach for environment variables in Expo
3. **Test Between Changes**: Verify the app still loads after each configuration change
4. **Keep It Simple**: The simplest solution (EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix) works best for most cases
5. **Don't Mix Approaches**: Choose one method for accessing environment variables and stick with it

## Current Status

The app is now loading correctly with the following configuration:
- `.env` file with properly prefixed variables: `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`
- Service files using `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` to access variables
- All original functionality maintained without additional dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the AI content generation with actual API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for cases where API keys might be missing
3. **User Experience**: Enhance the content generation UI with appropriate loading and error states
4. **Documentation**: Add clear comments about environment variable usage for future development
